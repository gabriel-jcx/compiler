This program is a quarter long project in which my partner and i wrote a 3 code language called "oc"
through a combination of C++, Flex, and Bison. The included files were written using pair programming
containing code from the both of us. The Makefile was not written by us and was provided by the professor
the code written by us are contained in the following files

astree.h
astree.c
parser.y
scanner.l
string_set.h
string_set.c
symtable.h
symtable.c
oiler.h
oiler.c

all other files were provided by the professor.
included in the zip is a very very brief writeup of the project
i submitted for my senior portfolio








This program was completed using pair programming.
Partner:  Nelson Yeap (nyeap@ucsc.edu)
Partner:  Chenxing Ji (cji13@ucsc.edu)

We acknowledge that each partner in a programming pair should
drive roughly 50% of the time the pair is working together, and
at most 25% of an individual's effort for an assignment should
be spent working alone.  Any work done by a solitary programmer
must be reviewed by the partner.  The object is to work
together, learning from each other, not to divide the work into
two pieces with each partner working on a different piece.

Nelson Yeap spent       0 hours working alone.
Chenxing Ji spent       0 hours working alone.
We spent                50 hours working together.
Nelson Yeap spent       25 hours driving.
Chenxing Ji spent       25 hours driving.
